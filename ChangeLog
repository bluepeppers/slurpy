slurpy v2.1.6
=============
New Features:
    * ChangeLog
    * Ability to upload packages to the AUR via -P|--push
        - Requires python-pycurl
    * Passing -v with -u will show old_version -> new_version
    * --ignore option.  Works just like pacman's --ignore
    * Added support for [community-testing]
    * -u now shows the currently installed version, to be more
      consistant with pacman

Bug Fixes:
    * Special characters in urls are now escaped (again)
    * Fixed test for packages in local database to support special
      characters in package name
    * Strip quotes from dependencies pulled from PKGBUILDS
    * Fix #12 - slurpy fails if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is undefined
    * Fix #14 - slurpy fails if no pacman.conf is found
    * Fix #15 - slurpy fails to download foo if foo-bar exists in
      pacman repos
